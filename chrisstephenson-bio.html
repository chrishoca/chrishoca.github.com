	  <li>Has worked since 1960's in the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics</li>
	  <li>Upon graduation from high school in 1966, he worked at IBM, developing a Domain Specific Operating System for a 16 bit computer, delivered to thousands of IBM customers</li>
	  <li>During his education in Mathematics at Cambridge University, one of his lecturers was John Conway, who invented the Game of life.</li>
	  <li>As a postgraduate he studied Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University. One of his classmates was Geoff Hinton, later co-inventor of back propagation in neural networks</li>
	  <li>While he was working at Reuters, he developed another real time Operating System</li>
	  <li>During the same period, he was actively involved in union movement and was an elected workplace union representative</li>
	  <li>In 1991, he moved to Turkey</li>
	  <li>After lecturing in the Computer Engineering departments at Marmara University and Yeditepe University, he was appointed by Ali Nesin to lecture at Istanbul Bilgi University, establishing the first ever Computer Science department in Turkey</li>
	  <li>Has been actively involved in expanding the popularity of open source software, becoming a pioneer of open source software in Turkey</li>
	  <li>Planned a visionary world class school curriculum parallel with top Computer Science programs in the world. Firstly around object oriented then emphasising functional programming to prepare students for the technologies of the future</li>
